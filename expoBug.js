This error typically occurs when you're using a feature or library in Expo that's not fully compatible with your current setup (e.g., using a specific version of React Native that isn't supported, or a library with native dependencies that aren't correctly linked). It could also be due to misconfiguration of your project's environment (like incorrect package versions, missing dependencies, or problems in the `expo.json` or `app.json` files).  Another possibility is that the build process is encountering unexpected issues while trying to integrate various components. This can be related to problems with your assets (images, fonts), or how your code is structured.
