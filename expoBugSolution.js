The solution depends heavily on the specific error encountered.  For example, a version mismatch may be solved by updating packages using `expo update` or modifying the `package.json` file to specify required versions.  Issues with native modules might require linking them correctly (if possible within the Expo managed workflow) or finding alternative solutions that avoid native dependencies.  Reviewing the error logs thoroughly and consulting the Expo documentation for your specific setup and used libraries is often crucial.  If asset problems arise, double check file names and paths.  Consider using Expo's debugging tools and examining the logs closely for clues.
